# Setting up your environment
Disclamer: these steps will work on linux, windows or mac not yet supported!

1. Open a terminal and navigate to where you want the luna folder to go
2. Run the command git clone this will download luna
3. Move into the luna directory
4. run the command make. If you get a command not found error, you may need to install make or g++.
5. If all goes well, after a few seconds you should end up with a luna executable in your current directory called luna.
6. Run it with the command ```lu``` if you don't have anything yet download a sample from the sample folder.
7. If it works, you can now move on to the "basic concepts" tutorial.
